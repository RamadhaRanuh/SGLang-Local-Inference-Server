# Basic Calculator Requirements

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the requirements for developing a basic calculator application.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Basic Operations
The calculator must support the following operations:
* Addition (+)
* Subtraction (-)
* Multiplication (*)
* Division (/)

### 2.2 User Interface
* Display a numeric keypad (0-9)
* Include buttons for each basic operation
* Provide a clear (C) button to reset the calculation
* Display the current calculation and result

### 2.3 Calculation Functionality
* Allow input of multi-digit numbers
* Perform calculations with two operands and one operator
* Display the result when the equals (=) button is pressed
* Handle decimal numbers

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Usability
* Interface should be intuitive and easy to use
* Buttons should be large enough for easy selection

### 3.2 Performance
* Calculations should be performed and displayed instantly

### 3.3 Error Handling
* Prevent division by zero
* Display Error for invalid operations

## 4. Constraints
* The calculator should work on standard desktop and mobile web browsers
* No scientific or advanced functions are required in this version

## 5. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
* Memory functions (M+, M-, MR)
* Scientific operations (sin, cos, log, etc.)
* Parentheses for complex expressions

I'll provide a comprehensive review of this PRD based on several key dimensions:

**Structure and Organization**
The document's structure and organization are generally clear and easy to follow. The sections are logically grouped, and the hierarchy is well-defined. The use of headings and subheadings helps to break down the content into manageable chunks. However, there are a few areas for improvement:

* The "Overview" section could be merged with the "Functional Requirements" section, as it provides little additional value.
* The "Non-Functional Requirements" section could be reorganized to group related requirements together (e.g

**Completeness**
Based on the provided document, I would rate the completeness of the PRD as 7 out of 10. The document covers the essential sections, including overview, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, and constraints. However, it lacks a clear definition of the target audience, user stories, and acceptance criteria. The functional requirements are well-defined, but some non-functional requirements, such as usability and performance, could be further elaborated. The document also assumes a basic understanding of the calculator's functionality,

**Clarity and Specificity**
Based on the provided document, I found the requirements to be generally clear, but there are areas where specificity could be improved. For example, in section 2.2 User Interface, the requirement for the numeric keypad is not specific enough. It would be better to specify the exact layout and size of the keypad. Additionally, the requirement for the clear button is not clear - is it a single button or a combination of buttons? In section 3.1 Usability, the requirement for the interface

**Consistency**
Based on the provided document, I noticed that the terminology used is generally consistent throughout the document. However, there are some minor inconsistencies in formatting, particularly in the section headings. For example, the section headings in the "Functional Requirements" and "Non-Functional Requirements" sections are not consistently formatted. Additionally, the "Constraints" section is not clearly labeled as a separate section. Overall, the document is well-structured and easy to follow, but some minor adjustments to formatting and section headings would improve

**Testability**
Based on the provided document, I assess that the requirements are generally written in a way that makes them testable. The functional requirements are specific and clear, making it easy to determine if a requirement has been met. For example, the requirement "The calculator must support the following operations: * Addition (+), Subtraction (-), Multiplication (*), Division (/)" is testable as it provides a clear and specific set of operations that the calculator must support. Similarly, the requirement "Display the current calculation

**Prioritization**
The document provides a clear overview of the requirements for a basic calculator application. However, the prioritization of the requirements is not explicitly stated. The functional requirements are listed in a straightforward manner, but it is not clear which features are must-haves and which are nice-to-haves. The non-functional requirements, such as usability and performance, are also important but are not prioritized. The constraints section provides some guidance on what is out of scope, but it would be helpful to have a clear priorit

## Summary of Recommendations
Based on the review, I recommend the following improvements:

1. Merge the "Overview" section with the "Functional Requirements" section.
2. Reorganize the "Non-Functional Requirements" section to group related requirements together.
3. Provide a clear definition of the target audience, user stories, and acceptance criteria.
4. Elaborate on non-functional requirements, such as usability and performance.
5. Improve the specificity of requirements, particularly in the user interface and usability sections.
6. Adjust formatting and section headings for consistency.
7. Prioritize the requirements, explicitly stating which features are must-haves and which are nice-to-haves.
8. Consider adding a section on acceptance criteria to provide clear guidelines for testing and validation.

By addressing these recommendations, the PRD will be more comprehensive, clear, and testable, providing a solid foundation for the development of a basic calculator application.```
