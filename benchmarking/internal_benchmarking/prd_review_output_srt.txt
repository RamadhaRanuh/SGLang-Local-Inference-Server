# Basic Calculator Requirements

## 1. Overview
This document outlines the requirements for developing a basic calculator application.

## 2. Functional Requirements

### 2.1 Basic Operations
The calculator must support the following operations:
* Addition (+)
* Subtraction (-)
* Multiplication (*)
* Division (/)

### 2.2 User Interface
* Display a numeric keypad (0-9)
* Include buttons for each basic operation
* Provide a clear (C) button to reset the calculation
* Display the current calculation and result

### 2.3 Calculation Functionality
* Allow input of multi-digit numbers
* Perform calculations with two operands and one operator
* Display the result when the equals (=) button is pressed
* Handle decimal numbers

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Usability
* Interface should be intuitive and easy to use
* Buttons should be large enough for easy selection

### 3.2 Performance
* Calculations should be performed and displayed instantly

### 3.3 Error Handling
* Prevent division by zero
* Display Error for invalid operations

## 4. Constraints
* The calculator should work on standard desktop and mobile web browsers
* No scientific or advanced functions are required in this version

## 5. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)
* Memory functions (M+, M-, MR)
* Scientific operations (sin, cos, log, etc.)
* Parentheses for complex expressions
```

I'll provide a comprehensive review of this PRD based on several key dimensions:

**Structure and Organization**
Thank you for your feedback. I have reviewed the document based on the dimension of Structure and Organization. The document has a clear and logical structure, with each section clearly outlining the requirements for the calculator. However, I would like to suggest some improvements to the flow of the document. Specifically, I would like to see more information on the user interface and calculation functionality. Could you please add more details on these sections?

**Completeness**
Thank you for your feedback. I have reviewed the document based on the dimension of completeness. The document includes all necessary sections, including overview, features, user stories, acceptance criteria, and requirements. However, I would like to suggest the following improvements:

- Add a section on error handling to ensure that the calculator is reliable and responsive.
- Include a section on performance optimization to reduce the time taken for calculations.
- Add a section on memory management to ensure that the calculator can handle large calculations without slowing down.

I hope these suggestions help improve the document. Please let me know if you have any further feedback.

**Clarity and Specificity**
Thank you for your feedback. I have reviewed the document and identified the following areas for improvement:

1. Non-Functional Requirements:
- The interface should be more intuitive and easy to use.
- The performance should be faster.
- The error handling should be improved.

2. Constraints:
- The calculator should work on standard desktop and mobile web browsers.
- No scientific or advanced functions are required in this version.

3. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope):
- Memory functions (M+, M-, MR)
- Scientific operations (sin, cos, log, etc.)
- Parentheses for complex expressions

4. Clarity and Specificity:
-

**Consistency**
Thank you for your feedback. I have reviewed the document based on the dimension of consistency. I have identified the following areas for improvement:

1. The use of "addition" instead of "sum" for the basic operations. This could be a mistake, but it is not a significant one.

2. The use of "equals" instead of "equals" for the "equals" button. This could be a mistake, but it is not a significant one.

3. The use of "C" button instead of "clear" button. This could be a mistake, but it is not a significant one.

4. The use of "display" instead of "display calculation" for the "Calculation Functionality" section. This could

**Testability**
