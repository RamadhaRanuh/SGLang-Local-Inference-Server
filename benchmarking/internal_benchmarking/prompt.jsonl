Overview\nThis document outlines the requirements for developing a basic calculator application.\n\n## 2. Functional Requirements\n\n### 2.1 Basic Operations\nThe calculator must support the following operations:\n* Addition (+)\n* Subtraction (-)\n* Multiplication (*)\n* Division (/)\n\n### 2.2 User Interface\n* Display a numeric keypad (0-9)\n* Include buttons for each basic operation\n* Provide a clear (C) button to reset the calculation\n* Display the current calculation and result\n\n### 2.3 Calculation Functionality\n* Allow input of multi-digit numbers\n* Perform calculations with two operands and one operator\n* Display the result when the equals (=) button is pressed\n* Handle decimal numbers\n\n## 3. Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### 3.1 Usability\n* Interface should be intuitive and easy to use\n* Buttons should be large enough for easy selection\n\n### 3.2 Performance\n* Calculations should be performed and displayed instantly\n\n### 3.3 Error Handling\n* Prevent division by zero\n* Display Error for invalid operations\n\n## 4. Constraints\n* The calculator should work on standard desktop and mobile web browsers\n* No scientific or advanced functions are required in this version\n\n## 5. Future Enhancements (Out of Scope)\n* Memory functions (M+, M-, MR)\n* Scientific operations (sin, cos, log, etc.)\n* Parentheses for complex expressions"}
